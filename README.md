The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, or Toller for short, is a medium-sized 
breed of gundog bred primarily for hunting. It is the smallest of the retrievers, 
and is often mistaken for a small Golden Retriever. Tollers are known to be 
intelligent, alert, high-energy dogs. Tollers get their name because of their 
ability to lure waterfowl within gunshot range. 
The breed originated in southwestern Nova Scotia, Canada, where they were used 
for tolling and retrieving ducks.
